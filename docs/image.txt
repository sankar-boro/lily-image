You need a much higher resolution when you want to make prints of your digital photos. For photos that will be examined closely – i.e. print sizes up to A4 – the recommended output resolution is 300 pixels/inch. For larger prints, which will be viewed from greater distances, the print resolution can be somewhat lower. The table below relates the output size required for high-quality photo prints to sensor megapixel counts.

Sensor Resolution (megapixels)	Typical Image Resolution (pixels)	Maximum Print Size	Print Resolution	Maximum Output Size
2.16	1800 x 1200	6 x 4 inch	300 dpi	Snapshot prints
3.9	2272 x 1704	7.6 x 5.7 inch	300 dpi	‘Jumbo’ snapshot prints
5.0	2592 x 1944	8.6 x 6.5 inch	300 dpi	8 x 6 inch enlargements
7.1	3072 x 2304	10.2 x 7.7 inch	300 dpi	A4 sized prints
8.0	3264 x 2448	13.6 x 10.2 inch	240 dpi	A4 sized prints
10.0	3648 x 2736	18.2 x 13.7 inch	200 dpi	A3 sized prints
12.1	4000 x 3000	20 x 15 inch	200 dpi	A3+ sized prints
14.7	4416 x 3312	22.1 x 16.6 inch	200 dpi	A2 sized prints
21.0	5616 x 3744	31.2 x 20.8 inch	180 dpi	A1 sized prints
